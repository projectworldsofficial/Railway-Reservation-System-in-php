#RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM should be able to manage all the reservation related functions.
#Each zone should have same functionalities. Each zone will stores the information about train name, 
#train schedules, availability. 
#The administrator should be able to enter any change related to the train information like change in train name, number etc. 
#The system should be able to reserve seat in a train for a passenger. 
#First the clerk will check for availability for the seats in a particular train on a specified date of journey. 
#If it is available the clerk will reserve seats. 
#The passenger will be given a unique PNR no. 
#The system should be able to cancel a reservation. 
#The clerk will delete the entries in the system. 
#The passenger can check their reservation status online by entering their PNR no. 
#The system will display his current status like confirmed, RAC or waiting list. 
#They are also able to see information related to the train schedules.
#The system should be able to print the report like it should be able to generate reservation chart, 
#train report, reservation ticket which will have train no and name, date of journey, boarding station, 
#destination station, person name, age, [censored], total fare and a unique PNR no. 
#The system should be able to print the cancellation ticket which will have total fare and the amount deducted.
 
#The main aim of the project was to develop a website which would facilitate the reservation of online air tickets through an effective and 
#yet simple GUI for a normal passenger intending to travel in airways. 
#Apart from reserving tickets, through our system a passenger can compare online fares ‘from’ various cities ‘to’ various cities.
